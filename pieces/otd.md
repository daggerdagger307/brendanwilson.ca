solution: Off The Dome

meta: Off The Dome is my own millinery company that I started with some friends. I have been sewing for many years and have always made my own sweaters and t-shirt but when the popularity of the 5 panel hat began I decided to try and make my own. After about 50 reiterations someone asked me where I bought it. I knew then I was on to something so I recruted two friends to help me scale the business and it has grown stealdy ever since. Enjoying sunny days in the Byward market selling hats is one of my highlights to the summer months. We realized quickly that my little Walmart sewing machine wasn't going to cut it for long and after sucsessfully running a kickstarter page we raised $6000 to buy some better equipment. With the new equipment we launched our website www.offthedome.ca and will soon be launching our own custom hat creator. Check out the site and build your own today!
