title: Propaganda Fitness Branding

meta: Branding and Identity for local clothing line.

solution: Propaganda Fist 

meta: To create a logo and graphic theme for local clothing line. This project was a designers dream. With a name like Propaganda Fitness so many things come to mind immediately, obviously WW2 propaganda posters was one of them. After sitting down with the client over coffee and discussing their likes and dislikes I went off to make something special. First after extensive research a colour pallet was chosen to work from right from the beginning. The theme of propaganda poster was a juice one and each of the designs uses a hint of WW2 poster art to keep the piece inline with the clients vision. The main logo uses a combination of the letter P, f and the image of a fist to make the fist logo. In the end the client was very happy and they continue to be one of my favourite clients.
