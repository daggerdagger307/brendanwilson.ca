title: Steam Whistle T-Shirt Design

meta: Entry for tee shirt design contest held by Steam Whistle Brewing co.

solution: The Brew Print

meta: To create a dynamic design that will be incorporated onto a T-shirt. Come up with one t-shirt design that you think would best fit within the Steam Whistle brand. You do not have to use the Steam Whistle logo within the design but the design must be fitting to the brand. Feel free to get creative! The design has to be within a maximum of 3 colours and using Steam Whistle brand colours either all or one of green, blue, grey. Your design will come from an extenstive research into the Steam Whistle brand so, the design has to reflect this and nothing out of brand but something that focuses on our initiatives, support for music, arts, not for profit communities, all natural ingredients and premium aspect of the brand; not for example sports. The initial part of the project will be the design the design that then will be incorporated into a poster as well.
